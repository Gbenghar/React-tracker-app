## My process
- Defined the project into various components
- Created the necessary folders and files to be used
- Installed Font-awesome as a package for additional styling
- 
- 

### Built with

- React
- React-DOM
- CSS custom properties
- JSX Syntax



### What I learned
I learnt about the use of various React hooks like:
1) useState as well as lifting state up
2) useEffect
3) ### Created functionalities
- Add/Close Button: Displays dynamically such that when either is clicked, it displays the AddTask Form as needed. When there is nothing to add it shows a close button to close the addtask form area when clicked and when there is a need to add task the Add button shows to display the addtask form.
- Save Task Button: The Task entered is further diplayed in the Task list
- Set-Reminder: The Set Reminder check-box indicates a green highlight by the edge of a task showing that its set for reminder and when double-clicked, the highlight is removed
- Fav-icon: When clicked it removes a task entirely from the list
4) Added some BackEnd functionality through json server.

I would continue to further learn about:
1) useContext
2) useReducer
3) useRefs


### Useful resources

- (https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8) - This helped me in simplifying and handling the task. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward especially the use of SCSS.
